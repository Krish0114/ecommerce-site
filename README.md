Urban Fashion is a fully functional, full-stack eCommerce website developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) with modern tools like Vite, TailwindCSS, Redux Toolkit, and React Router. This project was built to replicate the sleek and responsive design experience of top-tier fashion stores like those built on Shopify, while maintaining complete control over the backend and business logic. It caters to fashion retail, including categories like t-shirts, shirts, jeans, cargos, shoes, and accessories.

The frontend of the application is designed using React and powered by Vite for optimized performance and fast load times. TailwindCSS ensures a clean, mobile-first responsive UI, and Redux is used for efficient state management across the application. React Router handles smooth and dynamic navigation between pages. The backend is developed with Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust RESTful API to handle product listings, user management, order processing, and more. MongoDB, integrated through Mongoose, is used as the primary database to store and manage all data efficiently.

Urban Fashion supports secure online payments by integrating modern payment gateways like Razorpay and Stripe. It includes functionality for full, partial, and split payments, ensuring flexibility for both the platform and its users. The system also manages payment confirmations and order status updates using webhook-based communication. Authentication and authorization are implemented, supporting role-based access for admins and customers, with admin-level features to manage inventory and orders.

This project is structured into a client folder for the frontend and a server folder for backend APIs, with environment variables securely managed using .env files. It demonstrates practical implementation of scalable web development practices, real-time payment processing, user interface responsiveness, and backend API development â€” making it a strong example of applying full-stack development skills to a real-world business solution.
